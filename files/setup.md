# Setup

Copy and paste the `/picowiki/` folder to your server. **Boom, done.**

Now you are ready to start creating and editing Markdown files in the `/files/` folder.

### Optional customization

You can optionally edit `index.php` and customize the Wiki's title and a few more settings.

Edit the `favicon.png` and `style.css` to match your branding.

Furthermore, the PHP code is less than 100 lines of code and pretty straight forward to grasp and extend.
